# Just Recipe
This is a command line program to read, write and remove your own recipes.
## Note
"Just Recipe" is my first Rust project and acts as my first dabble with the language.
It is simply a way for me to learn the basics: how to read, write to files and use external crates as well as getting a general feeling for the language.
It is in **no way** inteneded to be effective at what it does, it simply acts as my first entry to to Rust.
